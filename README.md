[Check out the demo](https://conference-theme.netlify.app/) of what you'll get in less than 10 minutes, or [be inspired by creator stories](https://wowchemy.com/creators/).

## Notes

- To add your ticket booking services, setup your tickets on a platform such as https://eventbrite.com/ and then copy the links provided to each ticket which you offer in `content/home/tickets.md`
- By default, the CMS is disabled for demo purposes. To re-enable it, remove the `disable` line from the `modules` section of the `config.yaml` and uncomment the options in `content/admin/index.md`
