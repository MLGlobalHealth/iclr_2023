I am interested in applying and developing novel methods for outbreak analysis to help inform policy makers in real time.\nI am currently part of the Imperial College COVID-19 response team looking at real time modelling of Rt across Europe and the USA.\nMy fellowship focuses on using Hawkes Processes to model infectious disease in a new way. These semi-mechanistic models enable us to separate out the contribution to the burden of disease from both exogenous and endogenous events, which I believe will help give new insights to policy makers. I am currently applying these semi-mechanistic models to pre-elimination malaria data but believe they would be suitable to model a wide variety of different infectious disease outbreaks.\nI am a numerical modeller by background and was previously funded through a Bill \u0026amp; Melinda Gates Foundation grant to use mathematical models of malaria endemic areas to answer policy related questions. I mainly focused on two projects: modelling the impact of pyrethroid resistance on the mass community effect of insecticide treated nets and identifying gaps in current malaria interventions where the RTS,S malaria vaccine could be targeted.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"53342ccd77a9854701ca01fe4d232b16","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am an Imperial College Research Fellow (ICRF) based in the MRC centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis in the School of Public Health at Imperial College, London.
